## Overview

Base R ships with a lot of functionality useful for time series, in particular in the **stats** package. However, these features are not adapted to most archaeological time series. These are indeed defined for a given calendar era, they can involve dates very far in the past and the sampling of the observation time is (in most cases) not constant. 

**aion** provides a system of classes and methods to represent and work with such time-series (and time intervals). Dates are represented as *rata die* [@reingold2018], i.e. the number of days since 01-01-01 (Gregorian), with negative values for earlier dates. This allows to represent dates independently of any calendar: it makes calculations and comparisons easier.

Once a time series is created with **aion**, any calendar can be used for printing or plotting data (defaults to Gregorian Common Era; see `vignette("aion")`).

**aion** does not provide tools for temporal modeling. Instead, it offers a simple API that can be used by other specialized packages (see [**kairos**](https://packages.tesselle.org/kairos/) or [**ananke**](https://packages.tesselle.org/ananke/)).

```{r citation, echo=FALSE, comment='', results='asis'}
cite <- utils::citation("aion")
print(cite, bibtex = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the released version of **aion** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("aion")
```

And the development version from [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git("https://codeberg.org/tesselle/aion")
```

## Usage

```{r load}
## Load package
library(aion)
```

Time-series of ceramic counts:

```{r time-series, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
## Get ceramic counts (data from Husi 2022)
data("loire", package = "folio")

## Keep only variables whose total is at least 600
keep <- c("01f", "01k", "01L", "08e", "08t", "09b", "15i", "15q")

## Get time midpoints
mid <- rowMeans(loire[, c("lower", "upper")])

## Create time-series
X <- series(
  object = loire[, keep],
  time = mid,
  calendar = AD()
)

## Plot (default calendar)
plot(
  x = X, 
  type = "h" # histogram like vertical lines
)
```

Plot time ranges:

```{r time-intervals, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
## Create time intervals
Y <- intervals(
  start = loire$lower,
  end = loire$upper,
  names = rownames(loire),
  calendar = AD()
)

## Plot (default calendar)
plot(x = Y)
```

## Translation

This package provides translations of user-facing communications, like messages, warnings and errors, and graphical elements (axis labels). The preferred language is by default taken from the locale. This can be overridden by setting of the environment variable `LANGUAGE` (you only need to do this once per session):

``` r
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "<language code>")
```

Languages currently available are English (`en`) and French (`fr`).

## Related Works

* [**era**](https://github.com/joeroe/era) provides a consistent representation of year-based time scales as a numeric vector with an associated era.
